log.js
======

log.js is a simple tool that wraps the `console.log()`
 method call into a `log()` method call. You pass into `log()` the same things you would pass to `console.log()`. 
<br />
 log.js also checks to see if the console is defined before trying to do the console log to avoid browser issues.

This is intended for development purposes to speed up development.
